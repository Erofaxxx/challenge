## Competition Rules

Welcome to the Wunder Challenge! We're excited to see what you'll build. Here are the rules to ensure a fair and fun competition for everyone.

### The Basics

- **Who can join:** The competition is open to everyone, worldwide. You can participate as an individual or as part of a team.
- **How you're scored:** We use two leaderboards. The Public Leaderboard provides feedback on a sample of the test data. The Private Leaderboard, used at the end, determines the final winners on a separate, hidden dataset.
- **What you submit:** This is a code competition. You'll upload your inference code as a `.zip` file.

### Fair Play

- **No external data:** Your solution must only use the training data we provide. Using other datasets, pre-trained models, or external embeddings is not allowed.
- **Isolated environment:** Your code will run in an isolated Linux container with no internet access.
- **Sharing:** Please don't share your code, models, or detailed strategies publicly before the competition is over. Discussing general ideas is great, but sharing complete solutions isn't fair to others. Private sharing between participants is also not allowed.
- **Submissions:** You can make up to 10 submissions per day.
- **Single accounts:** One account per team/person. We won't see the #1 participant take all the winning ranks.
- **No messing with the infra:** We respect out-of-the-box thinking and the hacker way very much. If you crack our scoring system, leak the data or such — you'll have our regards, but you'll also be disqualified.

> Violation of the rules will lead to disqualification.

### Technical Rules

- **Execution environment:** Your code will run in a Linux container with Python 3.10+. A detailed list of installed libraries will be provided.
- **Resources:** The environment is CPU-only.
- **Time limit:** Your solution must complete its predictions on the test set in **60 minutes or less**.
- **Reproducibility:** Your code must be deterministic. Running it twice on the same data should produce the same results. Remember to fix your random seeds.

### Leaderboard and Tie-breaking

- **Final ranking:** Your final position will be determined solely by your score on the Private Leaderboard.
- **Tie-breaking:** If two participants have the exact same score, the participant who submitted their solution earlier will be ranked higher.
